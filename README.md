# countryembeddings
In this project I compare the relative size of countries in the GloVe model to external predictors of size, such as population, surface area and political power. 
The repository currently contains the code obtaining a relative size ranking for coutnries using semantic projection (Grand et al., 2022).
The same file contains the construction of a data-set obaining other data points for those countries. 
To follow is code for the data analysis (regression modeling, residual interpretation). 
This ongoing research was presented as a poster at CPSS, co-located with KONVENS2023, on 22 September 2023.
